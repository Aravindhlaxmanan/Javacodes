Testing cycle - basic understanding

BAU Code - Basic and important functionality available from the scratch development.

In the start buisness will allocate funds and will ready the requirments, then buisness analyst will check the requirments
and prepare an FR for that.

Then according to requirments developer will devlop and deploy the code in the same time tester will also design the cases according to
the requirments.

Then it will go to SIT Environment - it is like basic carbon copy (testing will be done over there)

Then Buisness analyst will check the tester designs and approve for execution.

Then code will deployed by the developer , Sanity (important function will tested ) will happen.

Then UAT- (User acceptance testing) will happen for the new inline code.

UAT1 Is based on CITI execution will be done after inline execution and before base regression.

After completing inline we will do regression(functionality before adding new codes) this have to work without any defects.

"Turn off regression cases" - Regression tests are designed to ensure that existing functionalities continue to work correctly after any code changes. 
Turning off regression cases means temporarily excluding these tests from the test execution process. 
This can be useful for speeding up the testing cycle or focusing on new tests
